Name: Nicolas Hortiguera
Uni: nh2648
Assignment: Final

Note: the assignment pdf mentions that the Git repo we upload should
contain a folder named uni-final. I followed the Git instructions from
the recitation, and I ended up placing my Git repo inside the folder, 
so what appears on GitHub are the contents of the folder and not the 
folder itself. I do not change this because I would have to artificially
do the changes to the files again in order to have the required number 
of commits (there is probably a better way to do this, but I do not know
how to). I apologize for this difference.
