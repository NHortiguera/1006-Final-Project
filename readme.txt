Name: Nicolas Hortiguera
Uni: nh2648
Assignment: Final

Note 1: the assignment pdf mentions that the Git repo we upload should
contain a folder named uni-final. I followed the Git instructions from
the recitation, and I ended up placing my Git repo inside the folder, 
so what appears on GitHub are the contents of the folder and not the 
folder itself. I do not change this because I would have to artificially
do the changes to the files again in order to have the required number 
of commits (there is probably a better way to do this, but I do not know
how to). I apologize for this difference.

Note 2: The name of the user that created this repo and the name of the 
user that uploaded the files seem to be different. In both cases it is me, 
but since I created 2 accounts when experimenting with GitHub this may
have led to the mix.
